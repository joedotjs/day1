# What is this?

Extra concepts will be included with each workshop and it is your opportunity to learn some extra stuff that was not
included in the lecture or previously in the workshop.

Each concept will be coupled with three things: an recorded video explaining the new concept, a problem in the context
of our application using that concept and a recorded video providing the solution to that problem.
