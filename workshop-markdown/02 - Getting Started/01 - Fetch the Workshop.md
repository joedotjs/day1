# Fetch the Workshop

For the purposes of this and upcoming workshops, we have scaffolded out an Express server for you that will serve up your
application. Angular lives on the front-end, so don't worry much about your backend! Feel free to explore, however.

```bash
git clone INSERT_REPO_HERE
```

This repo comes with a few built-in files, including an `index.html`, some stylesheets, an empty `app.js` and most
importantly the Angular Javascript library (`angular.js`)!

Now, we need to run our server. The file `start.js` in the project root folder is what we'll run in order to boot up
our server. In the project root folder, run `node start.js`. You should be able to access the index.html at
`http://localhost:1337`. You won't see much, but if your tab is titled "Flash Cards", you're good to go!
