# Getting Angular on our page

Using Angular in our `index.html` is easy and nothing new. We can include it in the same way we include any other
Javascript file or library.

The provided Angular.js file lives at `public/angular.js`. How can we include it?

<hint title="Solution">
In our `index.html`, add `<script src="public/angular.js"></script>`

Nice and easy!
</hint>

Also add our empty `app.js` file (which lives at `public/app.js`) so we can get started!
