# Adding our answers

We have our `question`, now let's put our `answers` on our template. Here is the existing html for answers:

```html
<ul class="flash-card-answers">
    <li class="flash-card-answer">
        I mean, yeah.
    </li>
    <li class="flash-card-answer">
        No, it's not.
    </li>
    <li class="flash-card-answer">
        What's a flash card?
    </li>
</ul>
```

We will use this structure, but get our `answers` from the scope. How do we go about this?

No solution in the hint this time, but if you're using ngRepeat, you're on the right track!
