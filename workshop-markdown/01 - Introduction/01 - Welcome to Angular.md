# Welcome to Angular

As the web matures from a platform to serve up documents and pages to one hosting and running robust, interactive
applications, the need for structure and discipline has arisen in HTML, CSS and Javascript. As a browser application
grows in size and complexity, tying together jQuery selectors or global variables is no longer viable for a
maintaining a reliable code base. Architecture and predictability become paramount.

Angular is a tool that allows for the creation of large browser applications. It establishes a general architecture and
patterns that solve common problems to allow for the building of front-end applications in a maintainable way and at a
productive rate.
